## Organization

The repository is organized into 8 different folders:

- analyses
    - Jupyter notebook containing code used to analyze data
- cozmo (files organized and named by timestamp (ID) of behavior; not all functions will have state information and vice versa)
    -  Function folder containing text files listing the functions that were ran for a behavior 
    -  States folder containing json files listing the internal state changes of Cozmo while behavior was running
- misty (files named by timestamp (ID) of behavior; not all functions will have state information and vice versa)
    -  Function folder containing text files listing the functions that were ran for a behavior 
    -  States folder containing json files listing the internal state changes of Misty while behavior was running
- cozmo_Filtered (files named by timestamp (ID) of behavior; all functions will have state information and vice versa)
    - Function folder containing text files listing the functions that were ran for a behavior 
    - States folder containing json files listing the internal state changes of Cozmo while behavior was running
- misty_Filtered (files named by timestamp (ID) of behavior; all functions will have state information and vice versa)
    -  Function folder containing text files listing the functions that were ran for a behavior 
    -  States folder containing json files listing the internal state changes of Misty while behavior was running
- raw_data
    -  cozmo_functions.pkl and misty_functions.pkl
       - pkl files which contains dictionary that maps behavior timestamps to functions used to run behavior for Cozmo and Misty
    -  cozmo_filtered_data.pkl and misty_filtered_data.pkl
       - pkl files containing dataframes of cleaned data for Cozmo and Misty
    -  cozmo_states.pkl and misty_states.pkl
       - pkl files containing dataframes of internal state data for Cozmo and Misty
    -  functions_cozmo.txt and functions_misty.txt
       - text files which contains all functions of every behavior ran labeled by behavior's timestamps
    -  response_cozmo copy.csv and response_misty copy.csv
       - csv file containing descriptions and affect labels for each behavior labled by behavior's timestamps
- resources
    -  cozmo_faces folder containing images used to generate Cozmo's faces
    -  misty_faces_black folder containing images used to generate black Misty's faces
    -  misty_faces_white folder containing images used to generate white Misty's faces
